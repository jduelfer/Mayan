A usable, searchable corpus created from the Preliminary Mayan Etymological Dictionary by Terrance Kauffman. You may use this code to
search through the dictionary to create frequency tests for phonotactic constraints and historical analysis. 
Before using this code, please download the Preliminary Mayan Etymological Dictionary and then insert the path into the top of the code. Then, look through the comments to see exactly what kind of output you would like. As of now, is plots the 
distance between strings as a Normal Distribution. Find frequencies as you would please.
